# Phase 2, Lecture 3: Information Flow

## Lecture Topics

- Callback functions as props
- Changing parent state

## Introduction

Today we'll continue to build our app for the pet adoption center, Flatapets, that displays a list of pets available for adoption at this pet adoption center. We will be adding a feature to this app that will allow the user to click a button to adopt a pet. Once a pet has been adopted, that pet should no longer be available for adoption. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out this new feature in this app.
